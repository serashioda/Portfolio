    "body":        "<p>I grew up in Tokyo and attended K through 5th grade there. I went to school 6 days a week, and was taught English on Saturdays by my American father, who ran several English schools areound Tokyo. I value the experience of the different approaches in education and even the interpretation of different subjects, such as history. I found that World War II was interpreted and taught different from the two sides. I found the value of doing my own research and finding my own truth. I moved to the U.S. at the age of 11, and attended 5th through 12th grade, and went on to University of Washington. I majored in Criminal Psychology, which was my own major developed under Independent Studies. To satisfy the requirements, I wrote a 60 page Senior Thesis on Sex Offenders. I minored in Japanese. I thought I wanted to become a Forensic Psychologist/Profiler, but decided against it for my own sanity. I studied for my GMAT, and almost pursued an International MBA at IE, Madrid. I also decided against that, and am now here, loving my new and intense life as a Software Engineer student at Codefellows! </p>"

Bento is a rescue, and Mongo is a Vegas doge, though he is the laid back, friendly one (unusual trait for a Shiba). Shiba Inu\"s are Japanese (like me!), and very stubborn (also like me!). Mongo and Bento are also pround parents of 3 litters, and I was priviledged to witness Bento give birth to and raise her pups. I kept one of the pups, Ginga for 6 years, who lives with my parents now in Kirland, along with her brother, Moo-Moo.</p>"
